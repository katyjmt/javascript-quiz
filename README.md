# Javascript Quiz

## Description
A timed quiz to test the user's JavaScript knowledge. The user gets 60 seconds to complete five multiple-choice questions. Each time an incorrect answer is given, the timer drops 10 seconds. The final user score is the time remaining at the end of the quiz. Once the quiz is complete, the user can submit their score to a 'high scores' board to see their result relative to previous attempts. The high scores are stored in local storage and can be cleared by the user if required.
